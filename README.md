I am a creative and passioned about everything I do women that always change her dreams to her goals.

The most thrilling thing about tech is that it has no limits - exactly the same as my imagination!

## Skills

#### Development Projects

Before I joined Makers Academy I was learning how to code on my own. Attending Codebar workshops every week and even made it to GDG DevFest London 2018 conference.
I was creating small applications using React and simple websites using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. I had no idea how to test my code at that time.

#### Team Work

As I was studying towards my Nursing degree I had to team up with the other students to work together during our practical classes. Without each other help and cooperation, we wouldn't do our job as a nurse. I realized that time that big part of my medical knowledge comes from learning from working with the other people and not only reading the book or articles.
