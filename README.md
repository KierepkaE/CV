## Karolina Kierepka

I am a creative and passionate woman.
When I have a dream, I make it into a goal, and I achieve it.
I never start something if I don't believe it is the right thing for the community but when I do start something, I always finish it.

Two years ago, completely by chance, I saw a video about programming. This became my biggest goal. For a year, I spent all of my free time on learning to code. I reached a point where I was programming, but I couldn't piece together a complete project. I then applied to Makers to train in their bootcamp program.

Now I feel like I can build anything. I understand problems better, and how to approach them.

The most thrilling thing about tech is that it has no limits - exactly like my imagination!

## Skills

#### Organising my time efficiently

When I was a nurse, I was working with a different team every day, and I had to constantly adapt my planning to manage both emergency and daily tasks. The more I had to do, the more efficient I was.

#### Dealing with customers

I worked in hospitality in Poland, South Korea and the UK. During that time I learned many things about dealing with customer needs.
I learned to be flexible as people's mind may change.
I learned that sometimes people don't have all the information and I had to always be one step ahead of the customer to anticipate their needs.
I learned to pay attention to each person individually, and to listen to their needs rather than assume their intentions.
Finally, I also learned to not take complaints personally but instead trying to looks at things from the customer's lens.

#### Learning from my peers and asking questions

As I was studying towards my nursing degree I had to team up with other students during our practical classes. I realised then that a big part of my medical knowledge came from my peers and not only reading books or articles.
At Makers, peer-led learning was a big part of the learning experience too.

This means that when I'm in a team, I know I won't be ashamed to fail, and I will be comfortable asking questions.

#### Leadership

I do not need to be a leader, but I do lead wherever their is a gap.

For several years, I organised horse-riding camps for my friends business. I was in charge of everything. I had to make decisions about each part of the camp, from which horse needed to be resting one day, to creating the camp programme, teaching horse-riding, taking calls from parents and dealing with their requests, etc.
